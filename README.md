### Project Overview

 The project was about the Nobel prize and its winners. We had to use python's various operators to gain insight about the data. For E.g who won the first Nobel prize for Women.


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt about YAML files, how to load them. I also learn about the  FOR , IF-ELSE, and ELIF loops.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I followed the simple notes from the GreyAtom leanring platform and I could solve it.


### Challenges faced

     For me  ,solving the problems with FUNCTIONS was little tricky. hence I took the  help from Stack Overflow to get the concepts clear in my mind


### Additional pointers

 Yes, Before directly writing down the code and solving it, it is a good idea to take a look at the data in ou rhand. By some simple python operators, the problems are solved.
